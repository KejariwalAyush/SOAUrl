- Custom name is first validated i.e., is the keyword already taken by any other user.
- Link is also validated if the link stated there has any data or not.
- After shortening a link User can sign in anywhere with help of google and track performance of the URL.
- User can track no. of clicks made to the shorten URL and which type of device is the consumer using to access the URL

## Features of SoaUrl?

 - And we have to different domains registered to us for ease of sending url.
 - One is soaurl.ml that is our main website.
 - Another website is soau.ml that works to further shorten the already shortened link.
 - Our app is made on flutter that promises you cross platform support.
 - Soon we are planning to expand to Windows and  Linux apps.
 - It enables you to create custom shortened URLs unlike other shorteners that provides an auto generated URL.
 - Here user can scan or make a QR code and directly share it from the app.
 - This was made using a flutter library for generating and scanning one.
 - User can save the QR’s for future reference and a history is maintained whenever user scans a QR – data is saved locally for history while for saved it is sent to backend server so user can access it from any where.
 - Up-to 25 QR data can be saved in the history.
